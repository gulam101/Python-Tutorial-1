With a comment you are able to comment large pieces of code or explain what code does. It make it easy to understand and it is different from C#.

Constraints: None

What I learnt: Since I am new to Python ever small and unique feature of Python I need to know. So I learnt how to write a comment. This will come in handy and I also improved my knowledge on the Python IDE.
