## Learning Python ##

### Description: ### 

In this project I was learning how to write comments in Python. Since I studied Python in college, I decided that I would continue learning and enhance my knowledge.

With a comment you can remove some code without the compiler executing the code. Large pieces of code can also summarised by using comments. Comments simply explain what code does. It makes it easy to understand and it is different from C#.

In Python you can have Single-line and Multi-line comments. 

Example of Multi-line comments:

"#" multiplying two variables
a=1
b=2
c=a*b
print(c) # print result

Another way of commenting code is using the Docstring method. This allows the user to put some information without the compiler executing it as code.

Example of how it works:

"""
Using Docstring as a comment.
This code divides 2 numbers
"""
