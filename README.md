Description: In this project I was learning how to write comments in Python. Since I studied Python in college, I decided that I would continue learning and enhance my knowledge.

With a comment you are able to comment large pieces of code or explain what code does. It make it easy to understand and it is different from C#.

In Python you can have Single-line and Multi-line comments. 

Example of Muti-line comments:

"#" multiplying two variables
a=1
b=2
c=a*b
print(c) # print result

Constraints: None

What I learnt: Since I am new to Python ever small and unique feature of Python I need to know. So I learnt how to write a comment. This will come in handy and I also improved my knowledge on the Python IDE.
